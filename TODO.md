# Current Focus: DATC Test Integration & Validation

## Phase 1: Backend Scaffolding ✅
## Phase 2: Core Game Logic ✅

**🎉 PHASE 2 COMPLETE - Full Diplomacy Game Engine Implemented**

All sub-phases completed:
- Phase 2A: Game Foundation ✅
- Phase 2B: Turn Management ✅  
- Phase 2C: Order System ✅
- Phase 2D: Basic Resolution ✅

**Current Status**: Complete end-to-end game flow working:
- Game creation → Player registration → Turn management → Order submission → Resolution
- 24 comprehensive tests passing (13.1% code coverage)
- Ready for commit: Resolution engine + test suite

## Current Task: DATC Test Integration & Refactoring

**Goal**: Integrate official DATC test cases while reducing test duplication.

**Completed**:
- [x] ✅ **COMMITTED**: Phase 2D resolution engine and comprehensive test suite (commit a602850)
- [x] ✅ **COMMITTED**: DATC test framework with 163 official test case stubs (commit 36edf08)
- [x] Complete end-to-end Diplomacy game engine with 25 passing tests
- [x] Fixed urllib-based DATC extraction (no external dependencies)
- [x] Generated 163 DATC test stubs across 10 categories

**Current Status**: 188 total test cases (25 passing + 163 DATC stubs)

**Current Plan**:
1. **Create Test Helpers**: Extract common setup to reduce duplication
2. **Implement DATC Tests**: Progressive implementation of official test cases
3. **Refactor Scenarios**: Replace custom scenarios with DATC equivalents

**Test Refactoring Strategy**:
```
backend/internal/api/
├── resolution_test.go          # KEEP - Core unit tests for resolution methods
├── integration_test.go         # KEEP - Full flow and edge case tests  
├── test_helpers.go            # NEW - Shared test utilities and setup
├── datc_basic_test.go         # NEW - DATC basic checks (Category A)
├── datc_coastal_test.go       # NEW - DATC coastal issues (Category B)
├── datc_circular_test.go      # NEW - DATC circular movement (Category C)
└── diplomacy_scenarios_test.go # REPLACE with DATC equivalents
```

**Next Steps**:
- [ ] Create shared test helpers (`test_helpers.go`) for common setup
- [ ] Implement high-priority DATC test cases (Category A: BasicChecks)
- [ ] Replace `diplomacy_scenarios_test.go` with DATC equivalents
- [ ] Progressive DATC implementation across all categories

**DATC Categories** (163 total test cases):
- **A: BasicChecks** (12 tests) - ⭐ **Start here** - fundamental validation
- **B: CoastalIssues** (15 tests) - Fleet/coast movement edge cases
- **C: CircularMovement** (9 tests) - Complex movement chains
- **D: SupportsAndDislodges** (34 tests) - Support mechanics and dislodging
- **E: HeadToHeadBattles** (14 tests) - Direct unit conflicts
- **F: Convoys** (25 tests) - Fleet convoy mechanics
- **G: ConvoyingToAdjacent** (20 tests) - Adjacent convoy edge cases
- **H: Retreating** (16 tests) - Retreat phase mechanics
- **I: Building** (7 tests) - Build phase mechanics
- **J: CivilDisorder** (11 tests) - NMR and disorder handling

## Next Phase Options

**Option A: Complete DATC Validation**
- Fix dependency issue in extraction script
- Implement all ~300 DATC test cases
- Achieve comprehensive resolution engine validation
- Estimated: 1-2 weeks

**Option B: Move to Phase 3 - AI Agents**
- Tactical AI engine (Go) for legal move generation
- LLM strategist integration (Python/DSpy)
- AI vs AI simulation capability
- Estimated: 3-4 weeks

**Option C: Frontend Development**
- TUI client using Bubble Tea (Go)
- Human-playable interface
- Map visualization and order submission
- Estimated: 2-3 weeks

**Option D: Advanced Game Features**
- Retreat and build phases
- Elimination and victory conditions
- Game history and replay system
- Estimated: 2-3 weeks

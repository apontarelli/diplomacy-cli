# Current Focus: DATC Test Integration & Validation

## Phase 1: Backend Scaffolding âœ…
## Phase 2: Core Game Logic âœ…

**ðŸŽ‰ PHASE 2 COMPLETE - Full Diplomacy Game Engine Implemented**

All sub-phases completed:
- Phase 2A: Game Foundation âœ…
- Phase 2B: Turn Management âœ…  
- Phase 2C: Order System âœ…
- Phase 2D: Basic Resolution âœ…

**Current Status**: Complete end-to-end game flow working:
- Game creation â†’ Player registration â†’ Turn management â†’ Order submission â†’ Resolution
- 24 comprehensive tests passing (13.1% code coverage)
- Ready for commit: Resolution engine + test suite

## Current Task: DATC Test Integration & Refactoring

**Goal**: Integrate official DATC test cases while reducing test duplication.

**Completed**:
- [x] âœ… **COMMITTED**: Phase 2D resolution engine and comprehensive test suite (commit a602850)
- [x] Complete end-to-end Diplomacy game engine with 24 tests (13.1% coverage)

**Current Plan**:
1. **Fix DATC Script**: Resolve `requests` dependency issue
2. **Extract DATC Tests**: Generate ~300+ official test cases organized by category
3. **Refactor Test Structure**: Create hybrid approach to minimize duplication

**Test Refactoring Strategy**:
```
backend/internal/api/
â”œâ”€â”€ resolution_test.go          # KEEP - Core unit tests for resolution methods
â”œâ”€â”€ integration_test.go         # KEEP - Full flow and edge case tests  
â”œâ”€â”€ test_helpers.go            # NEW - Shared test utilities and setup
â”œâ”€â”€ datc_basic_test.go         # NEW - DATC basic checks (Category A)
â”œâ”€â”€ datc_coastal_test.go       # NEW - DATC coastal issues (Category B)
â”œâ”€â”€ datc_circular_test.go      # NEW - DATC circular movement (Category C)
â””â”€â”€ diplomacy_scenarios_test.go # REPLACE with DATC equivalents
```

**Next Steps**:
- [ ] Fix `requests` dependency in extraction script
- [ ] Extract common test setup into shared helpers
- [ ] Generate DATC test files by category
- [ ] Replace scenario tests with DATC equivalents

## Next Phase Options

**Option A: Complete DATC Validation**
- Fix dependency issue in extraction script
- Implement all ~300 DATC test cases
- Achieve comprehensive resolution engine validation
- Estimated: 1-2 weeks

**Option B: Move to Phase 3 - AI Agents**
- Tactical AI engine (Go) for legal move generation
- LLM strategist integration (Python/DSpy)
- AI vs AI simulation capability
- Estimated: 3-4 weeks

**Option C: Frontend Development**
- TUI client using Bubble Tea (Go)
- Human-playable interface
- Map visualization and order submission
- Estimated: 2-3 weeks

**Option D: Advanced Game Features**
- Retreat and build phases
- Elimination and victory conditions
- Game history and replay system
- Estimated: 2-3 weeks
